## What is this ?

Discord Debian is an unofficial Discord client built on Electron, inspired by **Discord Canary and PTB. It integrates a CSS plugin system** (similar to BetterDiscord) to offer advanced interface customization while retaining Discord’s core stability and features.



##  Purpose 

- A lightweight, standalone, cross-platform client (Windows, macOS, Linux).

- An experience comparable to “preview” versions of Discord (Canary/PTB) without major instability.

- An easy way to apply CSS themes and plugins (e.g., BetterDiscord, ReShade, etc.).



## Key features

🔹 Electron
Based on Electron, Discordébian bundles Chromium and Node.js for a fast, modular client.

🔹 “Canary/PTB” Experience
Access to the latest features in preview (or near-preview) while maintaining acceptable stability.

🔹 CSS/Plugin Support
Native integration of a CSS plugin system inspired by BetterDiscord. Install themes and CSS scripts with minimal effort.

🔹 Cross-Platform
Runs on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.).

🔹 Auto-Updates
Uses Electron-Updater for seamless updates without manual intervention.
